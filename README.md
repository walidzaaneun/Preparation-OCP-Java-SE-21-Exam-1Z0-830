# Preparation-OCP-Java-SE-21-Exam-1Z0-830

Welcome! 👋
This repository contains my personal study notes and summaries from the book:

**_OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 21 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-830 (by Jeanne Boyarsky
Scott Selikoff)_**

<ins/>you can buy this book from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1394286619)

I am structuring this as a **Java project (Maven)** so I can test every concept directly inside an IDE.  
All examples are runnable through a simple `main` class, making the learning process more interactive and practical.
