# OCP EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

* Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java
  * Create classes and records, and define and use
  instance and static fields and methods,
  constructors, and instance and static initializers.
  * Implement overloaded methods, including var-arg
  methods.

In previous chapters, you learned how to write snippets of
code without much thought about the methods that
contained the code. In this chapter, you explore methods in
depth including modifiers, arguments, varargs,
overloading, and autoboxing. Many of these fundamentals,
such as access and static modifiers, are applicable to
classes and other types throughout the rest of the book. If
you’re having difficulty, you might want to read this
chapter twice!
