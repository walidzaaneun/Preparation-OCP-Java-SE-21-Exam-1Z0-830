# OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

### Controlling Program Flow
* Create program flow control constructs including
  if/else, switch statements and expressions, loops,
  and break and continue statements.

### Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java
* Implement inheritance, including abstract and
  sealed types as well as record classes. Override
  methods, including that of the Object class.
  Implement polymorphism and differentiate
  between object type and reference type. Perform
  reference type casting, identify object types using
  the instanceof operator, and pattern matching
  with the instanceof operator and the switch
  construct.


Like many programming languages, Java is composed
primarily of variables, operators, and statements put
together in some logical order. In the previous chapter, we
covered how to create and manipulate variables. Writing
software is about more than managing variables, though; it
is about creating applications that can make intelligent
decisions. In this chapter, we present the various decision-making
statements available to you within the language.
This knowledge will allow you to build complex functions
and class structures.
