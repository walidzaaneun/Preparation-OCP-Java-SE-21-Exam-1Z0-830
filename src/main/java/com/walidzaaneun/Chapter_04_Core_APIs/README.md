# OCP EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

* **Handling Date, Time, Text, Numeric and
  Boolean Values**
  * Use primitives and wrapper classes. Evaluate
    arithmetic and boolean expressions, using the
    Math API and by applying precedence rules, type
    conversions, and casting.
    
  * Manipulate text, including text blocks, using
    `String` and `StringBuilder` classes.
    
  * Manipulate `Date`, `Time`, `Duration`, `Period`, `Instant`
    and time-zone objects including daylight saving
    time using `Date`-`Time` API


* **Working with Arrays and Collections**
  * Create Arrays, `List`, `Set`, `Map` and `Deque`
    collections, and add, remove, update, retrieve
    and sort their elements.

In the context of an application programming interface
(**API**), an interface refers to a group of classes or Java
interface definitions giving you access to functionality.

In this chapter, you learn about many core data structures
in Java, along with the most common APIs to access them.
For example, `String` and `StringBuilder`, along with their
associated APIs, are used to create and manipulate text
data. Then we cover arrays. Finally, we explore math and
date/time APIs.
