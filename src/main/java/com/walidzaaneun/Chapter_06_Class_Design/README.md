# OCP EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

* Using Object-Oriented Concepts in Java
  * Create classes and records, and define and use
    instance and static fields and methods,
    constructors, and instance and static initializers.
    <br><br>
  * Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation,
    and create immutable objects. Use local variable
    type inference.  
    <br>
  * Implement inheritance, including abstract and
    sealed types as well as record classes. Override
    methods, including that of the Object class.
    Implement polymorphism and differentiate
    between object type and reference type. Perform
    reference type casting, identify object types using
    the instanceof operator, and pattern matching
    with the instanceof operator and the switch
    construct.

    
This chapter explores **class structure** and **inheritance**, which are
considered some of the most powerful features in the Java language.
It builds upon the basic class definitions from Chapter 1 and the 
methods/modifiers from Chapter 5.

## Core Goals of Class Design
Proper class design focuses on three main benefits:

* **Code Reusability:** Extending existing classes allows you to inherit
  primitives, objects, and methods, reducing the need to rewrite code.
* **Increased Functionality:** Leveraging existing structures to add 
  new capabilities.
* **Standardization:** Creating consistent structures across applications.

## Key Topics Covered

This chapter serves as a culmination of critical Java topics, including:

* Inheritance
* Constructors and Order of Initialization
* Overriding Methods
* Abstract Classes
* Immutable Objects
